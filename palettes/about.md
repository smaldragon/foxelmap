**Palettes used for light and biome shading**

Light Palettes Taken from minecraft wiki, with the exception of sunset and gamma.

Biome Palettes include biome colors parsed from minecraft wiki (grass,folliage,water_je,water_be) and the admist biome colors.

These biome colors do not take grass.png and folliage.png into account, and so may be inaccurate to the real game.
